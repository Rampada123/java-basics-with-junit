**Encapsulation in Java (Complete Notes)**

🔹 **What is Encapsulation?**

1. Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit called a
class.
2. It restricts direct access to data members of a class.
3. Data is accessed only through public methods (getters and setters).
4. Encapsulation provides data security and controlled access.
5. It is one of the four pillars of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).

**Why Encapsulation is Needed?**

1. Data Security
– Prevents unauthorized access to class variables.
2. Controlled Access
– We decide how and when data is modified.
3. Data Validation
– Invalid values can be restricted using setter methods.
4. Improves Maintainability
– Internal code can be changed without affecting other classes.
5. Real-World Modeling
– Works like real-life systems (ATM, Student record, Bank account, etc.).

**How Encapsulation is Achieved in Java?**

Encapsulation is achieved by:
1. Declaring variables as private
2. Providing public getter and setter methods
